## NeoCore 16x32 16-Bit CPU Emulator
Welcome to the 16-bit CPU emulator! This project is a C-language implementation of an emulator for an 16-bit CPU. The emulator is capable of simulating the behavior of a simple 16-bit CPU, executing instructions and manipulating memory.

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

# Features
Emulation of a simple 16-bit CPU
Execution of a variety of 16-bit instructions
Memory manipulation and access
# Requirements
A C compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
Make (optional, but recommended for building)
# Building and Running
To build the emulator, navigate to the root directory of the project and run make. This will create an executable file called emulator.

To run the emulator, execute the emulator executable with the path to a file containing 16-bit machine code as an argument. For example:

Copy code
./emulator path/to/machine/code/file
# Documentation
Detailed documentation for the emulator can be found in the gitlab wiki. This documentation includes information on the instruction set supported by the emulator, as well as the structure and function of the emulator itself.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions to the 16-bit CPU emulator! If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
